Dataset of high-pT jets from simulations from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadrom Collider in CERN. The aim is to do binary classification on jet-tagging, whether the jet originated from a quark or a gluon.

Includes: High level features (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06913). 
List: list of jet features with up to 30 particles/jet (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05318).
